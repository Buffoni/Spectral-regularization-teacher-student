## Introduction
This repository containts the code capable of reproducing the results of the paper **How a student becomes a teacher:
learning and forgetting through Spectral methods** by *L.Giambagli, L.Buffoni, L.Chicchi, D.Fanelli*.

To plot the result in the paper run the python file `main_results.py`. The code contains three different section that 
can be commented depending on the desired results. More specifically, the first section reproduces the results of the
scalars $\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{L}$,
